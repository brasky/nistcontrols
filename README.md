# nistcontrols
A search page for various NIST control frameworks that will eventually be started and hosted at nistcontrols.com. Based off the search functionality found at www.elliotdematteis.com:8000/controlsearch but with options to search 800-171, 800-53. I also plan to show what's selected for FedRAMP and provide mappings to non-NIST frameworks like hitrust, soc, etc.
